Lexical Analyzer 

Description: 
	- Created with C++
	- This project was assigned in my Programming Languages class     
	- We were asked to create a lexical analyzer to aid in parsing
	
	
*See PDF for full list Tokens and Token Constants


To run:
	- Add all files to a similar directory
	- Open command line
	- Once added, use the lex.exe file along with the lexer.cpp file to compile
	- Use sample.in and sample.out to vie expected inputs and outputs
	- Use test.in and test.out to test program
	- Output should display each character along with its associated token/identidier
